Among two of defining a Thread implement runnable interface is recommended . 

In the first Approach , Our class always extends Thread class , there is no chance of extending any other class class , hence we are 
missing inheritance benefit.

But in second approach , while implementing Runnable interface we can extends any other class , hence we won't miss any inheritance benefit
. 
Because of Above Reason , implementing Runnable interface approach is recommended than extending Thread class .
