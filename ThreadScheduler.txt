Thread Scheduler is a Part of JVM . It is responsible to schedule thread that if multiple Threads are waiting to get chance then 
it decides which Thread should allocate to processor. 

We can'nt expect output or exact algorithm of Thread Scheduler , it varies jvm to jvm.

suppose there are two threads , one is main thread and second is child thread so output may be following :

 first Possibilty :- 
 main thread
    |
    |
    |
 child Thread 
 
 Second Possibilty :- 
 child thread 
      |
      |
      |
 main Thread 
 
 Third Possibiliy :- 
 child Thread
 Main Thread
 child Thread
      |
      |
      |
     
 Fourth Possibility :- 
 Main Thread
 Child Thread 
 Main Thread
     |
     |
     |
