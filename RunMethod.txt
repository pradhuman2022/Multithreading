Difference Between start and run Method :- 


In case of start() , a new thread will be create which is responsible for execution of run() , But in case of direct calling of run()
, new thread will not be create and run() will be execute like normal method .

hence , in ThreadDemo.java  file , if we remove t.start() with t.run() so output is
  child Thread 
  child Thread
